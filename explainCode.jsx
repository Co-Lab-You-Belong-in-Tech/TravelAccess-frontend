// i try to create the login and signup just like the mock up but not with the properties exactly.
// i did not use  component - specfic - styles because of organization, i was having too much style - sheet
// and i could easily get things mixed up so i tried to use index.css(global sheet) only demarcarted it by using comments instead
// for the plenty inline class i used when i tried keep it at index file i was having plenty yellow lines.
// for header component i had to put default so i can link it up.
// A user -> login or signs up if no account, the login directs to header.
//    clicking on travelacess takes you back to homepage(login)



// pls delete the component when thru not part

// ........................homepage.................

//  for me to see what am doing i commented dashboard
// my idealogy is just thinking when a user login they see the homepage first then when they click on
//  trips it directs them to the dashboard
